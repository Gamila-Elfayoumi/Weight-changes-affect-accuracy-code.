# Weight-changes-affect-accuracy-code.
We will get to change weights in a real network and see how they affect model accuracy.
In this code:
Its weights have been pre-loaded as weights_0.
We will update a simgle weight in weights_0 to create weights_1, which gives a perfect prediction (in which the predicted value is equal to 3.
We will use the predict_with_network() function, which takes an array of data as the first argument, and weights as the second argument.
